Description: Spatio-temporal change of support (STCOS) methods are designed for statistical inference
	on geographic and time domains which differ from those on which the data were observed. In
	particular, a parsimonious class of STCOS models supporting Gaussian outcomes was introduced
	by Bradley, Wikle, and Holan <doi:10.1002/sta4.94>. The 'stcos' package contains tools which
	facilitate use of STCOS models.
