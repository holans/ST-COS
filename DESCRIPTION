Description: Spatio-temporal change of support (STCOS) methods are designed for statistical inference
	on geographic and/or time domains that differ from those on which the data were observed. 'stcos'
	implements a parsimonious class of Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal models for STCOS with
	Gaussian outcomes introduced by Bradley, Wikle, and Holan <doi:10.1002/sta4.94>.
