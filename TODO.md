Check the sin/cos example in basis functions. Does it actually work?

Make sure its safe to remove these:
- STCOSPrep
- gibbs.stcos


Now that we expose more of the internal interface, it needs documentation

Why is MLE function giving weird answers?
- I think there are a few area at the fine level with no intersection...

K computation
- Our paper assumes Sigma is symmetric pd; I think we need to mention it
- Jon's paper assumes S is semi-orthogonal, which we don't quite have here
